        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Kaijie Han and I am currently a 4th Year Biology Student at the University of California, Riverside. 
<br><br>

        During highschool, I held multiple roles in leadership and one being in a club named, Future Business Leaders of America. I was the secretary in the club so that meant that I was in charge of filing and organizing all the documents that came in and out. I also had to keep track of all the members and keep an organized list of the volunteer hours everyone had obtained. Through this role, I was given an insight to the business field and gained new found experiences. 
<br><br>

        I had immigrated to California when I was 3 years old so I started school here in the states and never attended school back in China. I had easily learned mandarin since I was speaking it often with my parents and had learned english through school. 
As of now, I currently hold a job at Glasgow dining where I work as a student server. As a student server, we are expected to keep the environment we are in clean and make sure to refill the food as needed. Through this job, I was able to learn what really goes on behind the scenes and was able to gain more work experience as this was the first job I have ever had. 
During the summer of 2021, I had received my realtor license and had signed onto a broker. By becoming a realtor, I was able to learn more about the housing market and what really goes on behind the scenes when someone wants to purchase a house as there are multiple things that need to be done in order to even put an offer on a house. 
With my biology degree, I had previously planned on applying to dental schools but due to Covid-19, my plans have changed or have at least paused for now. As of now, I am researching more about other career paths I can take on with this degree like becoming a researcher.
